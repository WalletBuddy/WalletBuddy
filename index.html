<p>WalletBuddy is a simple, fast and easy to use budgeting app. Keep track of your finances by splitting your transactions into categories. The best part? WalletBuddy doesn't require or track any of your personal information in order to track your budget. Simply set a budget and add transactions as you go!</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Users will create an account with WalletBuddy. After the account is set up, the user will set their budget and add categories. </p>

<p>The budget is split between several categories which will allow users to add transactions to the correct area. WalletBuddy keeps track of how much money is left on the budget and how much money you've spent on each category!</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Lin(<a href="https://github.com/dalin1120" class="user-mention">@dalin1120</a>) and I am a senior at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. This app came from my frustrations of having to constantly check my bank account to see if I was within my budget of buying an item. Hopefully it can help others who are trying to save money as well.</p>

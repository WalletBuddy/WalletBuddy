{"name":"WalletBuddy","tagline":"Android App to help you monitor your finances","body":"### What is WalletBuddy?\r\nWalletBuddy is a simple, fast and easy to use budgeting app. Keep track of your finances by splitting your transactions into categories. The best part? WalletBuddy doesn't require or track any of your personal information in order to track your budget. Simply set a budget and add transactions as you go!\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nUsers will create an account with WalletBuddy. After the account is set up, the user will set their budget and add categories. \r\n\r\nThe budget is split between several categories which will allow users to add transactions to the correct area. WalletBuddy keeps track of how much money is left on the budget and how much money you've spent on each category!\r\n\r\n### Enough reading, try it!\r\nTry and review my app! I am willing to add new features and listen to user feedback on what they want added.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dalin.mywallet.walletbuddy&hl=en\r\n\r\n### Creater and Developer\r\nMy name is Daniel Lin(@dalin1120) and I am a senior at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. This app came from my frustrations of having to constantly check my bank account to see if I was within my budget of buying an item. Hopefully it can help others who are trying to save money as well.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the app??

# WalletBuddy
A simple android app to monitor your finances.


#The Problem
Most budget/finance tracking apps are either clunky and non intuitive or they require too much information. Handing over sensitive information such as bank details or credit information to third parties may be seen as risky. There needs to be an alternative solution.

#Why WalletBuddy?
WalletBuddy offers a simple and easy to use interface. All users need to do is set a budget and categories and they are good to go. Add transactions as you go and WalletBuddy will update your data and display relevant information. WalletBuddy does not need any sensitive information in order to track your finances.
